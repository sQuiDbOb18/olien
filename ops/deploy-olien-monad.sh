# The four contracts go through the Arachnid CREATE2 deployer with fixed salts, so they
# land on the addresses Olien already holds on Arc and a piece that is somehow already
# there is reused rather than deployed twice. That makes this rerunnable: a run that
# dies halfway leaves the finished pieces standing and the next run skips them.
#
# Simulation is the default because broadcasting is the irreversible half. The readiness
# check runs first either way, since deploying onto a chain whose EntryPoint is not the
# one the code expects is the failure worth spending thirty seconds to avoid.
#
# The deploying key comes from DEPLOY_PK, or RELAYER_PK in service/.env, and is never
